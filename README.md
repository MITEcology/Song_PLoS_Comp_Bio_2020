The file contains the R-code and data:

- "01\_load\_data.r" loads the empirical data from [Web of Life](http://www.web-of-life.es/) and from [WorldClim](https://www.worldclim.org/). For convenience, the data from Web of Life is downloaded in the folder "network\_data", and the data from WorldClim is downloaded in the folder "wc2-5". The product of this R-code is "data.RData".
- "02\_pca\_plot.r" reproduces the main results (Figure 3 and Figure 4) in the manuscript.
